# tree-sitter-collection

The `tree-sitter` crate helpfully tells you exactly how to use
tree-sitter languages, which are generated C code.

This crate just does it for you. Well, for me. It's a crate
for me.

## FAQ

**Is this published?**

No! Use it from git, fork it, publish it yourself. This is for my
own usage.

**Which languages are included?**

The ones I use - see the `vendor/` directory

**Which version of the languages are used?**

See the `vendor/` directory - they're extracted zips downloaded
from GitHub. No, I don't want to use submodules.

**Why not publish this / add X**

Because I don't want to be maintaining yet another thing
right now. Sorry! But the tree-sitter docs brought you
90% there, this probably brings you 95% there, feel free to
silently do your own spin on it, just don't open issues.
